  <h1>WHAT ARE HTML AND CSS?</h1>
  <p>Basic web design uses two “languages”: HTML and CSS. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) governs the content and structure of a website, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls a website's appearance. (A third language, JavaScript, makes a website interactive.)</p>
  <div class="highlight">
  <p>A typical HTML structure consists of: <ul><li>a doctype declaration</li>
  <li>a head, which contains a title as well information about the language and content of the site, and</li> <li>a body, which contains the content</li></ul>
  <p>HTML5, the latest incarnation of HTML, uses semantic markup that describes the different parts of the page. For example, you can now use tags like <em>aside</em> or <em>article</em>.</p></div>
  <p>The head of an HTML document usually contains a link to the stylesheet that contains all the CSS information. You can try on different CSS design schemes almost like outfits. To see how drastically a simple change in CSS can affect the look of a website, visit <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com">csszengarden.com</a>.</p>
  <p>These days, people are just as likely to visit a website on an iPhone as a desktop computer. <em>Responsive design</em> ensures a good user experience on different media.</p><a href="#top"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-left fa-2x"></i></a>

    <h1>WHY LEARN?</h1>
<p>Web design is a very involved subject. If you've spent most of your time learning the difference between the AP and Chicago style manuals or trying to scope out the perfect synonym, you might wonder why you should embark upon this challenging field of study.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/technical-writers.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> has one answer for technical writers: "Experience with a technical subject, such as computer science, <em>Web design</em>, or engineering, is important." </p>

<p>Tom Johnson, publisher of the blog <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/2010/07/06/does-a-technical-writer-need-to-understand-web-design/">I'd Rather Be Writing</a>, declares, "About the only reason you wouldn't need to know anything about web design or development is if you're creating books in an attic."</p>

<p>On the <a href="https://www.freelancersunion.org/blog/2014/10/02/3-reasons-why-every-freelance-writer-should-learn-web-design/">Freelancers' Union blog</a>, Emily Pope explains, "Everything is moving (or already moved about 10 years ago) to the web, including documentation. If you create help in a print environment only, chances are you still publish the PDF on a website somewhere. Your online site is where the majority of your documentation should be available. Because of this, you need to understand how to author and design in a web environment.” Granted, Pope has a vested interest in encouraging writers to learn web design; she works at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>. But she argues that learning basic Web design will allow writers to: 1) increase versatility 2) build a personal brand and 3) communicate more effectively within multidisciplinary teams.</p><a href="#top"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-left fa-2x"></i></a>

        <h1>SOFTWARE</h1>
        <p>
          Technical writers are often expected to be proficient with a wide variety of software. Many programs incorporate HTML and CSS, so it is helpful to know these languages. Here is a brief list of software with HTML output.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.articulate.com/products/storyline-why.php">Articulate Storyline 2</a>. This software, which is used to create interactive e-learning programs, publishes to HTML5 for mobile browsers.</li><li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/robohelp.html">Adobe Robohelp</a>. The 2015 release of this popular help program uses HTML5 Responsive Layouts.</li><li><a href="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/">MadCap Flare</a>. The interface for this program, which uses single-sourcing to publish content in a variety of formats such as print, online, desktop and mobile, is based on HTML5.</li></ul><a href="#top"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-left fa-2x"></i></a></div>

    RESOURCES</h1>
    <p>Here is a list of learning resources. Some well-known websites, such as Codeacademy and Treehouse, used to offer completely free content but now charge for some or all features. Therefore, I have omitted these sites. I have also included some books that I find especially helpful.</p>
    <div class="section"><h3>Websites</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/projects/annas-website-1">Anna's Website</a><br/>
Snazzy slide-based mini-course from General Assembly. Learner works in the online text editor and sees results on-screen. Offers a lot of hands-on activities, and those who prefer slides to videos might enjoy the interface. While helpful, this introductory course has probably been engineered to gear learners towards the expensive paid content on this site.</li>

      <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491918055/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687502&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=1449325947&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=0P3X9B7KQX72V9AMKHMS">CSS: The Missing Manual</a><br>This comprehensive, 19-chapter book contains everything you need to know about CSS. Hands-on learners will appreciate the tutorial at the end of each chapter. You can download the homework files from the author's <span class="nodecoration"><a href="https://github.com/sawmac/css_mm_4e">Github repository</a></span>. Part 3 covers the challenging concepts of CSS page layout, including floats, responsive design, the grid system, and the newest flexbox layout mode.

      <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189">HTML & CSS: Design & Build Websites</a><br>This guide is quite visually appealing, and it contains a short primer on design and visual hierarchy at the end. There are many examples of code to scrutinize, but no exercises. Still, some instructors (like Yaakov Chaikin over at the Johns Hopkins Coursera course) feel that it is the best instruction manual out there.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Code-HTML-CSS-Websites-ebook/dp/B00JVQX7V8/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1">Learn to Code HTML and CSS: Develop and Style Websites</a><br>This book consists of 12 lessons. The author teaches HTML and CSS at the same time.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0133966151/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687442&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0321534042&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=0W2A12VTT81PVDW2Z0V2">The Non-Designer’s Design Book (Design and Typographic Principles for the Visual Novice)</a>.<br> While this book doesn't focus on web design, its principles are helpful for anyone looking to create an attractive visual presentation in any medium.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Murachs-HTML5-CSS3-3rd-Edition/dp/1890774839/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">Murach's HTML5 and CSS3</a></li>Half of this book is devoted to HTML and CSS, while the other half deals with JavaScript and other topics. There are many coding examples and graphics, which are all in black and white; color printing would have improved the usability of this reference guide.

<li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/say-hello-to-html-elements">Free Code Camp</a><br/>Free Code Camp is an "open source community of busy people who learn to code and help nonprofits." The site offers four certifications that take a grand total of 1200 hours (!) to complete. However, the HTML & CSS segment takes on five hours. Positioning is not covered (there's a bit about layout in the <span class="nodecoration"><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-responsive-design-with-bootstrap-fluid-containers">Responsive Design with Bootstrap</a></span> segment), but there is good information about CSS inheritance. The interface is slide-based.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/welcome">HTML, CSS and Javascript for Web Developers</a><br/>John Hopkins University’s free Coursera course. Instructor is very knowledgeable. Assignments are graded by peers, and discussion board is very active. Packs in an overwhelming amount of topics including advanced Bootstrap features, command line functions, and Github setup. Videos are very long and sometimes hard to follow.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Webpages</a> <br/>Khan Academy's free course. Has fun challenges, quizzes, and a unique interface. More introductory than other courses, and cutesy interface might be off-putting to some.</li>
<li><a href="http://learnlayout.com/">Learn Layout</a><br/>A 19-screen tutorial that covers display properties, CSS positioning (static, fixed, absolute, and relative), and the latest flexbox specification.Goes over various layout problems and provides solutions. Beginners and those who find CSS positioning difficult to learn might need more examples and some exercises to practice with.</li>
<li><a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV211.1x+1T2016/info">Microsoft's DEV211.1x</a><br/>Free edX course that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and external libraries.
Has helpful homework assignments and gives the user the ability to bookmark pages of the lesson. Videos are not too long. Omits CSS positioning; instead, the course abruptly throws in a flexbox layout without explanation. Also, although there are 10-question quizzes at the end of each unit, there is no feedback or grading on homework assignments.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/website-coding/home/welcome">Responsive Website Basics: Code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a><br/>University of London's brief Coursera course with an emphasis on responsive design. Engaging instructors, brief videos that aren't overwhelming. No information about positioning, which is a very challenging subject. Learners are advised to use a non-breaking space when coding a navbar.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools.com</a><br /> A definitive resource on all things related to Web design. Has many "try-it-yourself" examples. Has no videos, and is more of a reference than a lesson plan.</li>
